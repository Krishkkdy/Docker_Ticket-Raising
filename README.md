*<h1>Autobot Warehouse Dillema</h1>*
This Python-based simulation visualizes autonomous bots navigating through a warehouse environment using the A pathfinding algorithm. The program allows users to dynamically set obstacles, start points, and end points within a customizable grid. The GUI, built with Tkinter, offers interactive elements to configure the simulation environment, providing real-time visual feedback on the bot movements.*

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Welcome to the Autobot Warehouse Simulation project documentation. This document outlines the functionalities, setup instructions, and operational guidance for effectively running the simulation.

<h1>ðŸ“… <i>Prerequisites</i> </h1>

  <i>Essential Requirements:</i>
  
  <h2>Python</h2>
  
  -> The application is developed and tested in Python 3.8. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
  
  <h2>Tkinter</h2>
  
  -> This GUI toolkit is bundled with most Python installations. If it is missing, it can be installed via pip:
  
```bash
pip install tk
```

<h1>ðŸ“…<i> Installation</i> </h1>

<i>Setup Instructions:</i>

-> No additional installation is required beyond having Python and Tkinter. Simply download the script or clone the repository containing the project files to your local machine.

<h1>ðŸ“… <i>Running the Program</i> </h1>

<i>Operational Steps:</i>

<h2>Launch the Program</h2>

Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script through the command line:
```
python autobot_simulation.py
```


<h2>Configure the Simulation</h2>

The main GUI window displays a grid based on the specified size.<br>
1. **Enter Grid Size:** Upon launching, a small dialog will prompt you to enter the grid size. Input an integer value (e.g., 5 for a 5x5 grid). The maximum allowable size is 20x20.

2. **Interactive GUI:** After entering the grid size, a GUI window will open displaying a grid. You can interact with the grid to set up the simulation:
   - **Place Obstacles:** Click on the "Place Obstacles" button and then click on the grid cells to mark them as obstacles (red cells).
   - **Add Bots:** Click on the "+Bot" button. You will first click a cell to place the bot's start position (green cell), and then click another cell to set the destination (yellow cell).

3. **Start Simulation:** Once the bots and obstacles are set up, click "Start Simulation" to begin the pathfinding simulation. Each bot's movement will be shown step by step.
<li>Repeat the above steps as needed to place multiple bots.
<h2>Run the Simulation</h2>

<li>Once all bots and obstacles are placed, click "Start Simulation".<br> 
<li>The program will simulate each bot's journey from start to end, avoiding obstacles, with each bot displayed in a distinct color.<br>
<li>The movement of bots is animated in the grid, showing a step-by-step traversal based on the calculated path.
<h1>ðŸ“… <i>Additional Controls</i> </h1>

<li>Clear Grid: Resets the entire grid, removing all bots, obstacles, and paths.<br>
<li>Close: Exits the program.
<h1>ðŸ“… <i>Features</i> </h1>

<li>Interactive Grid Setup: Users can interactively place obstacles and define paths for multiple bots within the grid.<br>
<li>A Algorithm Implementation: The program utilizes the A search algorithm to determine the shortest path for each bot from its start to its end point, considering obstacles.**<br>
<li>Real-Time Visualization: Each step of the bot's path is visualized in real-time, allowing users to visually track the pathfinding process.<br>
<li>Multiple Bots: Supports configuring and running simulations for multiple bots simultaneously.
<h1>ðŸ“… <i>Troubleshooting</i> </h1>

Ensure all start and end positions are paired correctly; the simulation will not start if there is an unequal number of starts and ends.
If the grid does not respond to clicks, ensure that the program window is active and not minimized.
